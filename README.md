# learnyounode-answers

These are my code for NodeJS workshop held by nodeschool (http://nodeschool.io/). I suggest you to take some self-course at nodeschool to get started (or even deeper) into javascript (node, npm, functional programming, etc). I hope this repo could be fulfilled by end of this week.

Note that these answers might be hillarious. :D
